#disclaimer
Our travelling group consists of a bunch of hermits who prefer to be somewhere warm after sunset (especially in early winter) so that's how we tailored our itinerary - much relax and chill, and very little rush.

#reasons to leave our hermit habitat
Probably not on your typical list of places to visit in Japan, but Nikkō in the Tōchigi prefecture has all the elements to make your trip a fulfilling 'Japanese' experience (whatever that means). From the shrine where the first Tokugawa shogun was buried, to one of the three most beautiful ranked waterfalls in Japan, and just wild monkeys on the road, it really covers most things you need to see in Japan (who doesn't want to see wild monkeys crossing the road?). In fact, do these look familiar: U+1F648 U+1F649 U+1F64A? These three wise monkeys (みざる いわざる きかざる) you can find on most smart phones these days were actually made popular from a carving found in Tōshōgu (東照宮), the mausoleum of the first Shogun. Even Bashō (松尾 芭蕉, 1644 – 1694), the famous haiku poet from the Edo period, mentions Nikkō in one of his most famous work - The Narrow Road to the Interior (奥の細道 Oku no Hosomichi)- which is actually where I first heard of this little 'sunshine' (Nikkō literally translate to sunshine/sunlight) city. Bashō's haiku must have left an impact reading , because without any other prior knowledge of the place, it made it to our short Kantō itinerary, and I'm glad it did.

Something about nikko countryside, population, photo of sky. ?

Despite the city being lesser known outside of Japan, it flourishes as a popular local destination. Just hop on the Tōbu 東武 train that leaves from Asakusa, Tokyo and it will take you directly to the Tōbu Nikkō station in 2 hours or so. You can then find a network of buses, 3 lines in particular that center around the attraction sites. Since we also included Kinugawa (鬼怒川) in our trip, we went with the All Nikko Pass that covers exactly the four day period we were there for (Info found at http://www.tobu.co.jp/foreign/). It costs 4520 yen (in 2014) and gives us the flexibility to travel between all the attractions we wanted to visit without paying any extra. (Remember regarding time period of return trip).  This also allows you to ride on the bus lines mentioned above freely. ![The routes that the All Nikko Pass covers]({{imgUrl}}allnikkomap.png)
Just couple of important points to note:
- The pass includes *one* set of return tickets between Tōkyō (Tōbu line) and Nikkō. This means while you can travel freely within the Nikkō region, you can only go back to Tōkyō once
- You can order the ticket online, or just grab it at the Sightseeing Service Center at Tōbu Asakusa station. Staff were very helpful and can speak English.
- The time period of the pass is inclusive, which means if you get the All Nikkō Pass, you have to return to Tōkyō on the fourth day for it to be effective
- the pass does not include an express (Tokyuu) ticket, meaning you cannot ride on the Express trains unless you pay extra for it

    The train ride was pleasant and the weather was warm and cosy despite being December (Sasuga heading towards the sunlight city). Full of excitement as this was our first stop (S has looked past the disappointment during the train ride thankfully), we headed towards our lodge to checkin before commencing our exploration in the afternoon. (If you are staying somewhere further away, you can leave your luggage at the coin lockers at the station and do some touring first before coming back to collect them)

In choosing accommodation, (obviously price) but location is usually our biggest concern. We do not want to be lugging our heavy bags (should really have packed much lighter) up and down from the train station for too long. With that main criteria (and price and cleanliness and non-dodginess), we decided with the Nikkō Park Lodge, close-to-station version. We contemplated on a more green and scenic option of the Nikkō Park Lodge, but from the website it mentions a good twenty minute walk in the cold which we did not want to have with our pet bags. Apart from some weirdly positioned arm chairs in the room and the website probably would do good with a makeover, there is really nothing to complain about at the Nikkō Park Lodge. The one staff we met during check-in/out was quiet but friendly, room was spacious with air-conditioning/heater (something that makes your stay much more comfortable in December) and the beds were equipped with electric blanket (kind of homey and cosy right?). The room we booked had a small kitchen where we could cook breakfast, and a small balcony overlooking the town. (Photo of sunrise taken from the balcony)

While deciding on our accommodation for this trip, (or for almost all my other trips), location is key. Somewhere close to a train station that requires minimal walking. That way, when we get home late, we will be at the doorstep of our room. That was one of the criteria to choose Nikko Tobu Lodge. It was literally within 2 minutes from the train station. Of course, that was not the only criterion, it has to be clean and not dodgy looking and from the website (though the website might do with a good makeover), that gives us exactly what we needed. Costing [] per night, S and I had quite a big room with AC heater (definitely need that in December in Nikko). The floor staff was a quiet friendly gaikokujin (foreigner in Japanese) - maybe from South America? who took our luggages into the storage before we could check in later in the day (it was still before lunch then!).  - take the pamphlets with map! you will need it!
