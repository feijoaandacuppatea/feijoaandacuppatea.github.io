Having arrived in Nikkō before noon, we still had the bulk of the day ahead of us to explore the famous two shrines and one temple (2社１寺), one of must-see attractions in Nikkō.

#Getting there
We boarded the xxx bus (with route) and after a short twenty minutes, arrived at our first destination. Weather was lovely (Sasuga city of sunlight!) and warmer than we expected

#The two shrines and one temple (2社１寺)
Recognised as a World Heritage site in 1998, the Tōshō-gū (東照宮), Futarasan shrine and the Rinnō-ji  aren't just any shrines and temples you see all around Japan.
significance of why these are so clearly distinguished as the two shrines and one temple (in Japan historically and nowadays, the differences between shrines and temples are very vague, not clear distinction): originally Tōshō-gū was named Tōshō-sha (sha meaning shrine in Japanese before Ieyasu was buried and gū means palace). In 1871 - Meiji 4, there was the shinbutsubunrirei (神仏分離令) to separate all shrines from temples and burrning and destroying all temples are Buddhism was seen as the relgiion of the Tokugawa family. As the Meiji government wanted show people that they are different to the Tokugawa family and reinstate the imperial family, they raised the status of Shintoism from a national religion to state religion which protects and worship the emperor as the head of Shintoism.

The Tōshō-gū is the mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu (), the first Shogun of Japan. Extravagant and lavish, this was meant to show the power and wealth of the Tokugawa family.

Built by Ieyasu's son Hidetada according to Ieyasu's will to be buried in Nikko, this was later expanded and extravagant-ised by Iemitsu - the third Shogun and Ieyasu's grandson. It took a year and 5 months to complete, over 45 million workers involved costing around 15 billion yen in today's value.

Going up ___ flights of stairs, you will end up at Ieyasu's tomb - calming and breezy walk up the bamboo mountain

This is also where we found the 3 wise monkeys - ![Carving of the three wise monkeys]({{page.imgUrl}}mounkeyscarving.jpg) - which is the reason why I wanted to come to Nikko. It was smaller than I thought, but just look at these cute omamori keyrings![the 3 wise monkeys omamori]({{page.imgUrl}}threeWiseMonkeysKeychain.jpg)

Futarasan shrine: dedicated to Nikko's sacred mountains - mentioned in Basho's journal ![Futarasan]({{page.imgUrl}}futarasan.jpg)
Spanning 3400 hectars, the Futarasan shrine encapusulate the whole of the Nikko mountain area - from Chuuzenji (which we visited in part 2 the next day by bus). The main building was moved to next to the Tōshō-gū in 1619 and the oldest building in the Nikko mountain area.

Unfortunately the sun was setting and we didn't have enough time to see the third and only temple - the Rinnō-ji (closing time for winter beware) so we left it for the next day.

We did manage to sneak into a quick look into Taiyuibyo, the Mausolem of Iemitsu - grandson of Ieyasu.

On the way back, since we missed the last bus (be aware that the winter bus timetable ends very early!) we had to walk back to town centre. Luckily we did that since we were able to pass by this cute little music juke box shop, and the cute little shinkyo - which is also part of the Futarasan shrine - you can't cross it as it supposed to be meant for the gods to cross.

Another plus to having missed the bus was that we get to walk through the small town of Nikko in the dark, with dim lighting which was entirely a different atmosphere from when it's daylight.

We found early December to be a suitable time to visit, leaves were still intact and turning red (momiji), and the cold was manageable with proper coats.

We took our time to explore this area, unfortunately though, everything close at 5pm, with last entry at 4.30pm this time of the year (so research and be aware!) and it started to get dark around then as well. Definitely not a 'nightlife' city as most of the township was deserted by the time it got dark (not that it mattered very much since we aren't night people), but instead we enjoyed the tranquility of the night walking to grab dinner and supermarket for breakfast the next day.
