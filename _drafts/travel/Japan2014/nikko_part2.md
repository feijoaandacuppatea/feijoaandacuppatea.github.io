Since we weren't able to visit the Rinnouji temple (part of the two shrines and one temple - 2社１寺) the previous day, we got up early to do that before headed up north to Lake Chuuzenji and Yuumoto. (The original plan was to visit Edo Wonderland - a historical theme park set in the Edo period where you can dress up as ninjas and townspeople. It was supposed to be highlight of S's trip - but unfortunately the park was closed for maintenance during the time we were visiting so again! important thing to research before planning! don't fail like we did!)
