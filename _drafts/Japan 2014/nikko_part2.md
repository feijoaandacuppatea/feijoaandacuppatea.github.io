Since we weren't able to visit the temple of the two shrines and one temple (2社１寺) the previous day, we got up early to do that before headed up north to Chuuzenji. (The original plan was to visit Edo Wonderland - theme park where customers dress up in Edo period ninjas/townspeople - highlight of S's trip, unfortunately the park was closed for maintenance during this time so again research!)
