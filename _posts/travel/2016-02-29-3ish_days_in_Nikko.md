In 2014 December, the travel partners and I embarked on our little Kantō trip for ten days. We landed in Narita, Tokyo, and made our way up north first before going around Tokyo and Kanagawa (which is southwest of Tokyo). Our first stop was .....(drumroll please) this little sunshine city full of monuments and beauties.

(We had a slight disappointment when we found out the highlight of travel partner S - Edo wonderland, a theme park where you get to dress up as Edoites and roam around streets 300 or so years ago, was closed for maintenance during our time in Nikkō sadface :cry: she wanted to be a ninja)


##disclaimer
Our little travelling group consists of a bunch of hermits who prefer to be somewhere warm after sunset (especially in early winter) so that's how we tailored our itinerary - much relax and chill, and very little rush.
Also, photos came from both S and I.

##reasons to leave our hermit habitat
Probably not on your typical list of places to visit in Japan (usually consists of Tokyo and Osaka/Kyoto), but Nikkō in the Tōchigi prefecture has all the elements to make your trip a fulfilling 'Japanese' experience (whatever that means). Just couple hours by train north of Tokyo, you can visit the shrine where the first Tokugawa shogun was buried, experience one of the three most beautifully ranked waterfalls in Japan, and spot wild monkeys on the road, it really covers most things you need to see in Japan (who doesn't want to see random monkeys crossing the road right?).

Not to mention these three wise monkeys :see_no_evil: :speak_no_evil: :hear_no_evil:! The mizaru, iwazaru and kikazaru (みざる いわざる きかざる) monkeys were actually made popular from a carving found in the Tōshōgu (東照宮), one of the attraction sites in Nikkō. Even Bashō (松尾 芭蕉, 1644 – 1694), the famous haiku poet from the Edo period, mentions Nikkō in one of his most famous work - The Narrow Road to the Interior (奥の細道 Oku no Hosomichi)- which is actually where I first heard of this little 'sunshine' (Nikkō literally translate to sunshine/sunlight) city. Bashō's haiku must have left an impact, because without any other prior knowledge of the place, it made it to our short Kantō itinerary (Yay).

<!-- Something about nikko countryside, population, photo of sky. ? -->

We were here for three nights, two nights in the actual Nikkō city, and one in Kinugawa, an onsen (hot spring) town a lil bit up north, so this post will be split into three parts: [Nikkō Part1](../Nikko_part1), Part2 and Part3.

##sun and moon
As I said above, we visited Nikkō in early December, at the beginning of Winter. One morning it got unbearably cold with our gear that we couldn't feel our feet, but apart from that in general the weather was nice, sunny and warm. We had a thickish jacket with us (like a snow jacket or puffy jacket), some woolies and beanie, thick socks and boots, and we were good to go. No snow down in the main township during this time of the year, but once we went up the mountain, it was all white. (snowman time!)

Though, be aware of the sunset time. By the time it was 4.30, the sun was already setting, which cuts all the attraction sightseeing time short. (Though in winter, they tend to have much earlier closing time, so make use of your time!)



##moving around

Despite the city being lesser known outside of Japan, it flourishes as a popular local destination. Just hop on the Tōbu 東武 train that leaves from Asakusa, Tokyo and it will take you directly to the Tōbu Nikkō station in 2 hours or so. You can then find a network of buses, 3 lines in particular that circle around the attraction sites.

Since we also included Kinugawa (鬼怒川) in our trip, we went with the All Nikko Pass that covers exactly the four day period we were there for (Info found at http://www.tobu.co.jp/foreign/). It costs 4520 yen (in 2014) and gives us the flexibility to travel between all the attractions we wanted to visit without paying any extra. This also allows you to ride on the bus lines mentioned above freely.

*The All Nikko Pass (remember to keep it in a safe place throughout your journey)*

Just couple of important points to note:
- The pass includes *one* set of return tickets between Tōkyō (Tōbu line) and Nikkō. This means that while you can travel freely within the Nikkō region, you can only go back to Tōkyō once
- You can order the ticket online, or just grab it at the Sightseeing Service Center at Tōbu Asakusa station. Staff were very helpful and can speak English (as well as other languages such as Chinese and Korean).
- The time period of the pass is inclusive, which means if you get the All Nikkō Pass, you have to return to Tōkyō on the fourth day for it to be effective
- The pass does not include an express (Tokyuu) ticket, meaning you cannot ride on the Express trains unless you pay extra for it

The train ride was pleasant and the weather was warm and cosy despite being December (Sasuga heading towards the sunlight city). Full of excitement as this was our first stop (S has looked past the disappointment during the train ride thankfully), we headed towards our lodge to check-in before commencing our exploration in the afternoon. (If you are staying somewhere further away, you can leave your luggage at the coin lockers at the station and do some touring first before coming back to collect them)

##sleep

In choosing accommodation for Nikkō, (obviously price) but location is usually our biggest concern. We do not want to be lugging our heavy bags (should really have packed much lighter) up and down from the train station for too long. With that main criteria (and price and cleanliness and non-dodginess), we decided with the Nikkō Park Lodge, close-to-station version (It was literally 2 min walk from the train station). We contemplated on a more green and scenic option of the Nikkō Park Lodge, but from the website it mentions a good twenty minute walk in the cold which we did not want to have with our pet bags. Apart from some weirdly positioned arm chairs in the room and the website probably would do with a makeover, there is really nothing to complain about at the Nikkō Park Lodge. The one staff we met during check-in/out was quiet but friendly, room was spacious with air-conditioning/heater (something that makes your stay much more comfortable in December) and the beds were equipped with electric blanket (kind of homey and cosy right?). The room we booked had a small kitchen where we could cook breakfast, and a small balcony overlooking the town.

<!-- While deciding on our accommodation for this trip, (or for almost all my other trips), location is key. Somewhere close to a train station that requires minimal walking. That way, when we get home late, we will be at the doorstep of our room. That was one of the criteria to choose Nikko Tobu Lodge. It was literally within 2 minutes from the train station. Of course, that was not the only criterion, it has to be clean and not dodgy looking and from the website (though the website might do with a good makeover), that gives us exactly what we needed. Costing [] per night, S and I had quite a big room with AC heater (definitely need that in December in Nikko). The floor staff was a quiet friendly gaikokujin (foreigner in Japanese) - maybe from South America? who took our luggages into the storage before we could check in later in the day (it was still before lunch then!).  - take the pamphlets with map! you will need it! -->

##eat
Nikkō is famous for something called yuba, which is basically tofu skin. You can literally find it anywhere you go, with anything, but mostly with some sort of noodles like udon or soba.
