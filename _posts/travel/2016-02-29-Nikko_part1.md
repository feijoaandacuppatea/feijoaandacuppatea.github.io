Having arrived in Nikkō before noon, we still had the bulk of the day ahead of us to explore the famous two shrines and one temple (2社１寺), our main itinerary for the day. (woohoo!)

#Getting there
We boarded one of the attraction sight circle buses (a local bus) and after a short twenty minutes, arrived at our first destination. Weather was lovely (Sasuga city of sunlight!) and warmer than we expected

#The two shrines and one temple (2社１寺)
Recognised as a World Heritage site in 1998, the 2社１寺 which consists of the Tōshō-gū (東照宮), Futarasan shrine and the Rinnō-ji (the first two are shrines, the third one is the temple) are impressive each in their own right.
  (In Japan historically and nowadays, the differences between shrines and temples were and are very vague. But when the Meiji government overtook the Tokugawa Shogun and came into power, there was this policy shinbutsubunrirei (神仏分離令) to separate all shrines from temples, and destroyed the temples since Buddhism was seen as the religion of the Tokugawa family. All for the Meiji government wanting to showing how different they were from the Tokugaway family and reinstate the imperial family, by raising the status of Shintoism to the state religion, which worships the emperor as the head of Shintoism. Interesting ei =v=)



Another interesting fact, originally the Tōshō-gū was actually called Tōshō-sha, where sha 社 means shrine in Japanese, and Ieyasu (the first Tokugawa shogun) was buried there. So after the government wanting to separate between shrines and temples (temples being associated with Tokugawa and the 'bad'), they had to change the name to 'gū', which means palace.

## Tōshō-gū

<!-- But firstly, let's talk about the differences between shrines and temples in Japan.  
significance of why these are so clearly distinguished as the two shrines and one temple (in Japan historically and nowadays, the differences between shrines and temples are very vague, not clear distinction): originally Tōshō-gū was named Tōshō-sha (sha meaning shrine in Japanese before Ieyasu was buried and gū means palace). In 1871 - Meiji 4, there was the shinbutsubunrirei (神仏分離令) to separate all shrines from temples and burrning and destroying all temples are Buddhism was seen as the relgiion of the Tokugawa family. As the Meiji government wanted show people that they are different to the Tokugawa family and reinstate the imperial family, they raised the status of Shintoism from a national religion to state religion which protects and worship the emperor as the head of Shintoism. -->

<!-- The Tōshō-gū is the mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu (), the first Shogun of Japan. Extravagant and lavish, this was meant to show the power and wealth of the Tokugawa family. -->

Anyway, the Tōshō-gū is the mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu, built by Ieyasu's son Hidetada, and later extravagant-ised by Ieyasu's grandson Iemitsu, to show the power and wealth of the Tokugawa family at the time.
<!-- Built by Ieyasu's son Hidetada according to Ieyasu's will to be buried in Nikko, this was later expanded and extravagant-ised by Iemitsu - the third Shogun and Ieyasu's grandson. It took a year and 5 months to complete, over 45 million workers involved costing around 15 billion yen in today's value. -->

Going up some hundred flights of stone steps, you will end up at Ieyasu's tomb. Don't be put off by the stairs, it was a calm, breezy walk in surrounded by a mountain of bamboo.

This is also where we found the 3 wise monkeys!

*Carving of the three wise monkeys*
one of the main reason I wanted to visit Nikko. It was smaller than I thought, but just look at these cute omamori keyrings!

*The 3 wise monkeys omamori, I chose the speak-no-evil one as a reminder ha ha ha*

  (Do you know why monkeys are used to represent these sayings? In Japanese, they are: miwazaru, kikazaru, iwazaru, which are translated roughly from olden Japanese to do no see, hear or speak [evil]. "saru" means monkey in Japanese, so it's really a play on the words)

## Futarasan shrine 二荒山神社
Dedicated to Nikko's sacred mountains, which was also mentioned in Basho's haiku journal
![Futarasan]({{page.imgUrl}}futarasan.jpg)

It spans 3400 hectars, and encapusulate the whole of the Nikko mountain area, from this shrine, to Chuuzenji (which we visited in part 2). This main building was actually moved next to the Tōshō-gū in 1619 and is the oldest building in the Nikko mountain area.

It is also known to be an enmusubi (relationship) shrine (just look at the cute heart shape things you put your omikuji on! - omikuji is usually a small piece of paper where some fortune telling thing is written on it, and depending on what you get you are meant to tie it onto a tree branch or somewhere within the shrine)
![Heart shaped things to tie your omikuji on]({{page.imgUrl}}heartSHapedOmamori.jpg)

Unfortunately the sun was setting and we didn't have enough time to see the third and only temple - the Rinnō-ji (again, beware of the closing time for winter) so we left it for the next day.

## Taiyuibyo 大猷院廟
We did manage to sneak into a quick look into Taiyuinbyo (大猷院廟), the Mausolem of Iemitsu - grandson of Ieyasu. Much more stoic looking than his grandfather's, but still grand enough. Couldn't get a closer look though since it was near closing time :( :sadface:

![Going up the stairs to the tomb]({{page.imgUrl}}silouette.jpg)

On the way back, since we missed the last bus (again beware that the winter bus timetable ends very early!) we had to walk back to the town centre. It was good that we missed out last bus, because we got to pass by this cute little music jukebox shop, and the cute little bridge shinkyo 神橋 - which is also part of the Futarasan shrine. Translated to the gods' bridge, it's not meant for humans to cross.

![music box]({{page.imgUrl}}musicBox.jpg)
*cute music jukebox - I think they have the same shop in Otaru and Kyoto Arashiyama as well*

![origons]({{page.imgUrl}}origon.jpg)
*and more cute music jukeboxes, or they call them origons?*

![shinkyo - the bridge for the gods]({{page.imgUrl}}shinkyo.jpg)

Another plus to having missed the bus was that we get to walk through the small town of Nikko in twilight. Dim lighting on the streets, giving an entirely different atmosphere from daytime. (We were almost the only ones on the street walking back to town, plus one to our love for small towns !)

![Nikko at night]({{page.imgUrl}}nikkotownAtNight.jpg)

We found early December to be a suitable time to visit, leaves were still intact and turning red (momiji), and the cold was manageable with proper coats.

We took our time to explore this area, unfortunately though, everything closes at or before 5pm, with last entry at around 4.30pm this time of the year (so research beforehand!). It also started to get dark around then as well (which can be nice). Definitely not a 'nightlife' city as most of the township was deserted by the time it got dark (not that it mattered very much since we aren't night people), but instead we enjoyed the tranquility of the night walking to grab dinner and supermarket for breakfast the next day.
