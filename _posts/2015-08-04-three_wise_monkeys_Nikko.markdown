You know the 3 monkeys emoticons that you can often see on mobile IM apps? They represent the 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' maxim that was popularised by a carving found in Nikko - located north of Tokyo, Japan, and one of the main reasons we decided to visit Nikko on our 2014 December trip to Japan.

Explanation of Mizaru, Kikazaru, Iwazaru on photo
- Mizaru, Kikazaru, Iwazaru
- Japanese is an agglutinative language, where the root of the verb is inflected at the end  - and in this case,
- 'mi(ru)' to see, 'kik(u)' to hear, 'i(u)' to say
- inflected with zaru - which in classical Japanese denotes the negative present tense
- zaru or saru - can also mean monkey (you will see often a voiceless consonant /s/ becomes voiced /z/ when you glue two Japanese nouns together)

I first heard of Nikko from my Japanese Edo (dates) literature course through Basho's (dates- one of the most famous haiku master)'The Narrow Road to the Deep North (Oku no Hosomichi)' which documents Basho's travel to the North, starting from Edo (today's Tokyo). Nikko was the 5th station on Basho's journey -

In antiquity, the name of that holy mountain was written Nikousan  [Two-Storm Mountain]. but the Great Teacher Kukai changed it to Nikko [Sunlight] when he founded the temple."Classical Japanese Prose: An Anthology, edited by Helen Craig McCullough pg525]

hi no hikari]                 the radiance of the sun!


We departed early from Tokyo (where we stayed at a business hotel the previous day in Kanda - cheap deal through jaran.net!) and went to the Train station Info Centre in the JR Asakusa Station to buy our Nikko all pass for our four day trip. The unforeseeable doomed upon us when travel partner S found out that the highlight-to-be of our trip: Edo wonderland was closed during the time we were there (remember to check when they close off if you are also planning to visit to avoid disappointment!). I had to comfort her by telling her that we will definitely come back again and make it before we turn 30.

The train ride was pleasant and the weather was warm and cosy despite being December. [photo of sky tree and inside train]. Full of excitement as this was our first stop of our trip (S has looked past the disappointment during the train ride thankfully - something about the atmosphere in Nikko Tobu Station helped lift the spirit, can't cloud us after all we are in the Sunlight city itself blahblah), we had to take a selfie at the station after everyone got off the train in this deserted clean, yet cosy train station. We were probably the very few foreign travellers on board and showing our pass to the train person (better word), we headed off to check in first.

While deciding on our accommodation for this trip, (or for almost all my other trips), location is key. Somewhere close to a train station that requires minimal walking. That way, when we get home late, we will be at the doorstep of our room. That was one of the criteria to choose Nikko Tobu Lodge. It was literally within 2 minutes from the train station. Of course, that was not the only criterion, it has to be clean and not dodgy looking and from the website (though the website might do with a good makeover), that gives us exactly what we needed. Costing [] per night, S and I had quite a big room with AC heater (definitely need that in December in Nikko). The floor staff was a quiet friendly gaikokujin (foreigner in Japanese) - maybe from South America? who took our luggages into the storage before we could check in later in the day (it was still before lunch then!).  - take the pamphlets with map! you will need it!

With most of the day still ahead of us, we boarded one of the 3 touring-route buses to our first destination - or destinations should I say - the 2 shrines 1 temple (word for sightseeing place/tourist spot). Nikko is a true tourist town, with the local buses catered for the attraction sites. When I say tourist-ful, I really mean full of local tourists, local Japanese from other parts of Japan (Japan flourishes in its local tourism). We boarded the crowded [bus number] and after 20 or so minutes arrived at the area where
(The friendly staff at the lodge also suggested walking, which would have taken 30 or so minutes, but it was cold and we had our free pass so better make use of it!)

[more on the temples? - Ieyasu's tomb, photo grid instead of words]
- something on meibutsu maybe

- tips: Nikko (or Northern Japan in general) sets very early in winter, by four, it was almost dark and was hard to see anything. Nothing dangerous (especially if you travel in groups, Japan is probably one of the most safe places you can wander after dark.) But it was cold and we were all hungry - and we realised the last bus also caters for this early sun setting, and departs relatively early. - also the temples/shrines also close quite early, last entry at []. so look at the timetable of bus if you don't want to miss it!.

- we missed our bus, but not without merit. We were able to stumble across [music box shop: which I have also seen branches in Otaru and Kyoto- Arashiyama]. We spent a good half hour there just admiring all the different types of music juke boxes [photo explanation] (Sorry C!)
- also we were able to walk past the God's bridge [whatever the name is in Japanese] which is also one of the attractions recommended to us.
Walking on the one main road in Nikko city at night (it wasn't even five yet!) was charming, with hints of cold (better word?) and hunger. We decided to head all the way back to our room first before coming out for dinner. There are many choices of local shops around so we had plenty to choose from (caters for both my vegetarian companion S and meat lover C)
